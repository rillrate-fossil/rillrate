- **_It's fully custom_** - You add your own data streams with everything you want
- **_It works in real-time!_** - NOT `5 secs` real-time, it's `0.002 secs` real-time ðŸš€
- **_Zero-configuration_** - you don't need to install and configure any other software
- **_Web-dashboard included_** - add the library to your app and connect to the dashboard with a web browser
- **_Ferris-friendly_** - we created it using Rust only: from backed to UI ðŸ¦€

### How to use it?

Add a dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rillrate = "0.37.0"
```

Install the **rillrate** engine in the `main` function:

```rust
rillrate::install("my-app");
```

And create a `Tracer` to visualize data on the embedded dashboard:

```rust
let my_tracer = Pulse::new(
    ["package", "dashboard", "group", "tracer-name"],
    None, // You can add a specification here: depth, ranges, labels, etc.
);
```

When you tracer is spawned use it to put data to it:

```rust
tracer.push(value);
```
