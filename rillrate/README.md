## RillRate

### Real-time UI for bots, microservices, and IoT

RillRate is a library that embeds a live web dashboard to your app.

Fast, embedded, with auto-layout and controls. No configuration is needed.
**Support**: [Rust][rillrate-rs], [Python][rillrate-py]. _Soon_: Node.js, Java, C#.

- **_It's fully custom_** - You add your own data streams with everything you want
- **_It works in real-time!_** - NOT `5 secs` real-time, it's `0.002 secs` real-time ðŸš€
- **_Zero-configuration_** - you don't need to install and configure any other software
- **_Web-dashboard included_** - add the library to your app and connect to the dashboard with a web browser
- **_Ferris-friendly_** - we created it using Rust only: from backed to UI ðŸ¦€

### How to use it?

Add a dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rillrate = "0.40.0-rc.1"
```

Install the **rillrate** engine in the `main` function:

```rust
rillrate::install("my-app");
```

And create a `Tracer` to visualize data on the embedded dashboard:

```rust
let my_tracer = Pulse::new(
    "package.dashboard.group.tracer-name",
    FlowMode::Realtime,
    PulseOpts::default().min(0).max(50).higher(true)
);
```

When you tracer is spawned use it to put data to it:

```rust
tracer.push(value);
```

### Packs

RillRate provides packs of components for different purposes.

Released:

- **Prime** - basic elements

In progress:

- **APM** - components for performance monitoring
- **Charts** - all basic charts
- **Trade** - live components for trading (order books, charts, etc.)

### Project structure

The project consists of the following parts:

- `pkg-core` (backend) - core components and the engine
- `pkg-dashboard` (frontend) - the dashboard app and rendering routines
- `pkg-packs` - tracers for different data stream types
- `rillrate` - the main library that joins all the parts above
- `demo` - the demo app

### Frameworks

We use the following frameworks to build our product:

- [Yew][yew] Framework (frontend)
- [meio][meio] actor framework (backend)

The original idea was inspired by [Nitrogen][nitrogen] Web Framework (Erlang).
