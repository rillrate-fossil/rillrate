## RillRate

🚧 The project is under **active development** and the working version will be released **this week** (before Aug 8 2021).

### UI for Microservices, Bots and IoT devices.

- **_It's fully custom_** - You add your own data streams with everything you want
- **_It works in real-time!_** - NOT `5 secs` real-time, it's `0.002 secs` real-time 🚀
- **_Zero-configuration_** - you don't need to install and configure any other software

### How to use it?

> TODO!

**The data protocol and the async engine.**

This protocol and the project is strongly inspired by the [Nitrogen](https://nitrogenproject.com/)
Web Framework (Erlang).
